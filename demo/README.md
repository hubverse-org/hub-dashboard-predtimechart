This directory contains predtimechart files generated by running `src/hub_predtimechart/app/generate_json_files.py` on the `tests/hubs/example-complex-forecast-hub` directory, along with an `index.html` page that sets up predtimechart to use those files. Load `index.html` to see the visualization, but note that you'll need to serve it instead of opening directly in your browser due to CORS restrictions (e.g., "CORS request not http" in [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSRequestNotHttp)). You can serve the file in Python, for example, like this:

```bash
cd <this_repo>/demo
python3 -m http.server --cgi 8080
# visit: http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
