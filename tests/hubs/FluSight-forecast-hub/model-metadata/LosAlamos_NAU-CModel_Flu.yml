methods: "A compartmental model with Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification and calibration."
data_inputs: "State level daily hospitalization data from HealthData.gov."
methods_long: "We employed a compartmental model that features a time-dependent transmission rate as the base model. Using Bayesian inference, we parametrize the transmission rate from hospitalization data. Subsequent steps involved uncertainty quantification and model calibration."
